Projects I've done and problems I've solved in Julia for my Mathematical Programming class. 
The first is hardcoding a neural network to read the characters 'M', 'A', 'T', 'H'. Cheeky.
The second is an exercise in graph theory applied to word sequences: I make a graph connecting words that have a single letter different. From here, I look at word ladders i.e. paths from one word to another consisting of the closest neighbors on this graph.
